These will be the first few instructions:
	add
	sub
	mul
	div
	lw
	sw
	and
	or
	xor

The parser will take a buffer with a single instruction and parse it into a instruction data type.

There are 2 types of instructions: arithmetical-logical and memory.

Once they're parsed, they will get executed.

The parser needs to only do what stated above, nothing else.

PARAMETERS: char* buffer
RETURN: instruction

struct instruction:
	-type

struct arlog_instruction:
	-type
	-operation (0: ADD, 1: SUB, 2: MUL, 3: DIV, 4: AND, 5: OR, 6: XOR)
	-int reg1 (store register)
	-int reg2 (first opperand)
	-int reg3 (second opperand)

struct mem_instruction:
	-type
	-operation (0: LW, 1: SW)
	-int reg1
	-int reg2
